## For Us By Us
This website is for the engineering team. It is a place for everyone to discuss what Software Development means to us. We all want to create great products. Let's start with our core principles. 

## Submitting Ideas/Updates
Everyone has access to this repository. But instead of making it a free-for-all, let's use the Issue Tracker and Pull Requests to submit changes to the site. They offer a good way to have conversations about what each principle should stand for.
